# Variables and Data Types

When you define a variable, you are placing information into computer memory.

### Var
Globally scoped variable 

The classic way to define a variable is with the keyword "var"

```javascript
var container = 5;
```
Var was the default for many years. You will most likely come across it.

You can define multiple variables on a single line:
```javascript
var container = 5, bucket = true, hat = 'white';
```

### Let
Is block scoped so you have less scoping issues. It is also mutable.

### Const
Is also block scoped, but is immutable
