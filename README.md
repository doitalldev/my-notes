# My Notes
These are just notes I take in Markdown. Potentially I'll put them on a site down the road, but for now they live here.

## Why?
I'm spending time going back and reviewing the fundamentals in order to build a stronger foundation and understanding. I also plan to continue to build this repo with newer technologies. I find I learn best when I write things down, this allows me to also format and share the knowledge.

I hope they help you just like they help me!
