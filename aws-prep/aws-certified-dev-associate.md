# What is AWS?

A collection of cloud computing services that can be run together or seperately.

AWS is a provider of cloud services.

## Why use AWS?

#### Cost

You aren't buying hardward like servers themselves, storage, networking, and even space in a building. Cloud services provide all of this at a rate.

These costs would all be upfront as well. You'd have to get all of this and set it up even before offering your product to your customer.

With AWS there are not upgront costs (for more services).

#### Scalability

You can fail by being successful. It takes a lot of work to normally add servers and may required config and wait times. With AWS and cloud services, it's as easy as point and click to spin up new servers.

#### Global

On premise means more latency for customers further away. With cloud, your application can be hosted on servers in a closer location to the end user, there is also the added benefit of increased redundancy.
