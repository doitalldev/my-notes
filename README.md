# My Notes
These are just notes I take in Markdown. Potentially I'll put them on a site down the road, but for now they live here.

## Why?
I'm spending time going back and reviewing the fundamentals in order to build a stronger foundation and understanding. I also plan to continue to build this repo with newer technologies. I find I learn best when I write things down, this allows me to also format and share the knowledge.

I hope they help you just like they help me!

P.S. Sorry if my Javascript notes are lacking. It is my daily job so it can be hard for me to want to retype everything I normally type every day. If you'd like to add on, please make a PR.
