## What is AWS?

A collection of cloud computing services that can be run together or seperately.

AWS is a provider of cloud services.

### Why use AWS?

#### Cost

You aren't buying hardward like servers themselves, storage, networking, and even space in a building. Cloud services provide all of this at a rate.

These costs would all be upfront as well. You'd have to get all of this and set it up even before offering your product to your customer.
